Develop the Oracle of DSCOVR - Experimental Data Repository NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023

DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) is an American space weather station that monitors changes in the solar wind, providing space weather alerts and forecasts for geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power grids, satellites, telecommunications, aviation and GPS - https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/DSCOVR/in-depth/

When operating reliably, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) space weather station, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), can measure the strength and speed of the solar wind in space, which enables us to predict geomagnetic storms that can severely impact important systems like GPS and electrical power grids on Earth. DSCOVR, however, continues to operate past its expected lifetime and produces occasional faults that may themselves be indicators of space weather. Your challenge is to use the "raw" data from DSCOVR—faults and all—to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth.

What is Currently Measured by DSCOVR:

The DSCOVR Faraday Cup is the instrument that provides the solar wind density, speed, and temperature used by NOAA to run its forecast models. NOAA refers to the densities, speeds, and temperatures as "level 2" data. These quantities are not measured directly, however; the instrument actually measures the entire spectra of solar wind particles over time and then computes those quantities from the spectra. These spectral data are referred to as "level 1" data, or sometimes as "raw" data. 
To work well, a space science experiment must be stable and well-calibrated to translate the "raw" data into the more useful "level 2" data. DSCOVR no longer meets this criteria; in its old age, certain electrical anomalies and faults have been observed that shift the calibration and introduce noisy signals in unpredictable ways into DSCOVR raw data. When these faults occur, NOAA generally attempts to identify them and switches to a backup weather station rather than attempting to recalibrate or mitigate the error to produce the level 2 data accurately.

Challenge: use the "raw" data from DSCOVR—faults and all—to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth. Currently, NOAA relies on stable, well-calibrated level 2 data for its forecasts (see Potential Considerations). We challenge you to develop your own geomagnetic activity forecast using the raw DSCOVR data directly as input. When you are interpreting your results, think about what satellite operators, electrical utilities, the airline industry, the armed forces, and others need to consider when they are relying on a forecast from an aging instrument. It is important to be able to predict geomagnetic activity as quickly and accurately as possible.

THE DATA:

The data files in this repository contain measurements from the DSCOVR PlasMAG instrument suite, recorded in the solar wind near the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange Point between 2016 and present day.

Each file corresponds to one year of measurements. The measurements themselves have been condensed and decimated to a cadence of one measurement set per minute.

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2016 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2017 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2018 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2019 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2020 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2021 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2022 Data

DSCOVR PlasMAG 2023 Data

These data are provided in a human-readable text format, with one one-minute measurement set per line. The measurements that comprise each set are separated by commas.

WHAT IS IN A MEASUREMENT SET?
Each line begins (column 0) with a date and time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), formatted like YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. So, for example, October 7, 2023 at 9:00 a.m in Greenwich, England, would be written 2023-10-07 09:00:00.

The next three values in the line (columns 1-3) represent components of the magnetic field vector that was measured at this time. They are expressed in units of nanoTesla (nT) and provided in the Geocentric Solar Ecliptic reference frame (GSE).

The last fifty values (columns 4-53) represent a "raw" measurement spectrum from the Faraday cup plasma detector. Each value corresponds to the flux, or flow strength, of the solar wind in a particular range of energies (or flow speeds). These numbers are not calibrated or converted-- they are dimensionless numbers as encoded in the instrument computer.

WHY ARE SOME OF THE NUMBERS ZERO?
The PlasMAG detectors do not take data all of the time, and the Faraday cup does not make measurements over its full range every minute. Whenever and wherever no data are available, the field is filled in with an integer 0. We recommend converting these to "NaN" in your computing environment after you load the data.

HOW SHOULD I LOAD THESE DATA?
These data have been formatted to be as accessible as possible, no matter what tools you prefer to use.
