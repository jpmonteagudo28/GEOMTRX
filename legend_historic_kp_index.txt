# Kp, ap and Ap
# The three-hourly equivalent planetary amplitude ap is derived from Kp and the daily equivalent planetary amplitude Ap is the daily mean of ap.
# Kp is unitless. Ap and ap are unitless and can be multiplied by 2 nT to yield the average geomagnetic disturbance at 50 degree geomagnetic latitude.
# Kp, ap and Ap were introduced by Bartels (1949, 1957) and are produced by Geomagnetic Observatory Niemegk, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences.
# Described in: Matzka et al. (2021), see reference above.

# F10.7 Solar Radio Flux
# Local noon-time observed (F10.7obs) and adjusted (F10.7adj) solar radio flux F10.7 in s.f.u. (10^-22 W m^-2 Hz^-1) is provided by 
# Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory and Natural Resources Canada.

# Short file description (for a detailed file description, see Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107_format.txt):
# 40 header lines, all starting with #
# ASCII, blank separated and fixed length, missing data indicated by -1.000 for Kp, -1 for ap and SN, -1.0 for F10.7
# YYYY MM DD is date of UT day, days is days since 1932-01-01 00:00 UT to start of UT day, days_m is days since 1932-01-01 00:00 UT to midday of UT day
# BSR is Bartels solar rotation number, dB is day within BSR 
# Kp1 to Kp8 (Kp for the eight eighth of the UT day), ap1 to ap8 (ap for the eight eighth of the UT day), Ap, SN, F10.7obs, F10.7adj
# D indicates if the Kp and SN values are definitive or preliminary. D=0: Kp and SN preliminary; D=1: Kp definitive, SN preliminary; D=2 Kp and SN definitive
#

# The format for each line is (i stands for integer, f for float):
